# AirlineDataChallenge
An Airline company is planning exploring airline investment for the US domestic market. The company’s motto is “On time, for you”, so
punctuality is a big part of its brand image. We plan to use 1Q2019 data to address the following problems：
1. The 10 busiest round trip routes in terms of number of round trip flights in the quarter.
Exclude canceled flights when performing the calculation.
2. The 10 most profitable round trip routes (without considering the upfront airplane cost) in
the quarter. Along with the profit, show total revenue, total cost, summary values of
other key components and total round trip flights in the quarter for the top 10 most
profitable routes. Exclude canceled flights from these calculations.
3. The 5 round trip routes that you recommend to invest in based on any factors that you
choose.
4. The number of round trip flights it will take to breakeven on the upfront airplane cost for
each of the 5 round trip routes that you recommend. Print key summary components for
these routes.
5. Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) that you recommend tracking in the future to
measure the success of the round trip routes that you recommend.
